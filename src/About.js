        <p className='about_fiveline'>Whether that's ditching the mid-afternoon energy slump so you can be active with your kids after school, <br></br>banishing the expanding midsection that's making it harder to slide into your work trousers each passing<br></br> year, or finally having the body confidence to buy clothes that show off your physique, rather than hide it</p>

        <p className='about_sixline'>In just 42 days we'll take you from feeling frustrated with your current trajectory, to feeling proud of<br></br> the positive habits you've built</p>
